# Counter App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This has been deployed on [Netlify](https://counter-app-karan-saraswat.netlify.app/).

## Rules

* By default, the initial value and the max value has been set to 1 and 1000, respectively.
* The max value can be changed to any valid numerical value while the initial value is the one that is received through the given API, which can't be changed.
* The value in the counter can be incremented as well as decremented by 1 or its value can be changed to any valid number lesser than or equal to the max value.
* The max value can also be changed but if its value gets lesser than the counter's value, the counter's value will become equal to the max value.
